# ============== Ubuntu Repositories ==============
# See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/upgrading-linux-nodes/

Configuration of the APT system repositories is stored:
    /etc/apt/sources.list       file
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d     directory

Edit the file to enable and disable repositories:
    comment out the appropriate line, ex.:  # deb cdrom:[DISTRO-APT-CD-NAME - Release i386 (20.......

Extra repos:    In addition to the officially-supported package repositories available for Ubuntu, there are also community-maintained repositories which add thousands more packages for potential installation.
Two of the most popular repos (enabled by default):
    - Universe
    - Multiverse


Switching to another Kubernetes package repository:
    1. vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

    2. You should see a single line with the URL that contains your current Kubernetes minor version; for ex., when using v1.29, there should be:
        deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /

    3. Change the version in the URL to the next available minor release, for ex.:
        deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.30/deb/ /

    Save the file and exit your text editor.
    Continue following the relevant upgrade instructions.

sudo apt update
sudo apt-cache madison kubeadm

Upgrading control plane nodes:
    The upgrade procedure on control plane nodes should be executed one node at a time.
    Pick a control plane node that you wish to upgrade first. It must have the /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf file.
    Call "kubeadm upgrade": For the first control plane node
        Upgrade kubeadm:
        # replace x in 1.30.x-* with the latest patch version
        sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm='1.26.15-1.1' && \
        sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
                # some GUI, session dropped
        Verify that the download works and has the expected version:
    
        kubeadm version
    
        Verify the upgrade plan:
    
        sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
