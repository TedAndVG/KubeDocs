Enable ssh for GitHub


In Windows:
	- Generate key pair in ~\.ssh\ dir.
	- No need to change your permissions. Go to ~\.ssh, right-click Properties, Security Tab, Advanced. DISABLE INHERITANCE.
	- When you are disabling the inheritance you will be asked if you want to copy the current inherited access right. 
	- Accept that.
	- Then, click on the Administrator user (the one that is not you) and Remove them. Apply. Done.


On GitHub:
	- Go to upper right  -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys 
	- New SSH key -> add public key content from ~\.ssh\
	- Add SSH key
